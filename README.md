### A little bit about me :rice_ball:

I am a design technologist with a pragmatic and data-driven approach to building products. I work at the intersection of design, tech and business, building things through code, design thinking and a touch of data science.

I look forward to brewing coffee in the morning, and have a fascination with folding bicycles and mechanical keyboards.
